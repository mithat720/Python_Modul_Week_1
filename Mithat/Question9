 #Question 9: How to create a combination of loop and conditional statement that takes a word input from the user and checks whether that word is a palindrome (the same when read backwards)?
word=input('enter a word ')
for i in word:
    reverse=word[::-1]
if word==reverse:
    print('Entered word is a polindrom')
else: print('Entered word is not a polindrom')
