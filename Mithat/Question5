#Question 5: Write a Python program that takes a positive integer input from the user and calculates its factorial. Factorial is the product of all positive integers between a number itself and 1.
#For example: if the user entered 5, the program should give the following output:
#Enter a number from the user: 5
#Factorial: 120

n=input("enter a positive number ")
while not n.isdigit() or int(n)<1:
    n=input("Please enter a valid positive number ")
factorial=1
i=1
while i <=int(n):
    factorial=factorial*i
    i=i+1
print("factorial: ", factorial)
